# Advanced Convex Hull Implementation (C++)

This repository provides an advanced implementation of the Convex Hull algorithm in C++ without the use of external libraries. The Convex Hull is a fundamental algorithm in computational geometry that finds the smallest convex polygon that contains all the given points in a 2D plane.

## Introduction

The Convex Hull algorithm is widely used in various applications such as computer graphics, image processing, pattern recognition, and computational geometry. It is used to find the outer boundary or the convex envelope of a set of points.

This advanced implementation provides a highly optimized framework for utilizing the Convex Hull algorithm in a C++ project. It includes the necessary functions for finding the convex hull of a set of points using the QuickHull algorithm, which is known for its efficiency in handling large point sets.

## Getting Started

To use this implementation in your C++ project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.
2. Include the `ConvexHull.h` header file in your project.
3. Add the `ConvexHull.cpp` source file to your project's compilation.

## Usage

To use the Convex Hull algorithm in your application, follow these steps:

1. Create a vector of 2D points (`std::vector<std::pair<double, double>>`) representing the input points.
2. Create an instance of the `ConvexHull` class.
3. Call the `computeConvexHull()` method, passing the vector of points as an argument.
4. The `computeConvexHull()` method will return a vector of 2D points representing the convex hull.

Refer to the example section for a more detailed demonstration of the usage.

## Algorithm

The Convex Hull algorithm implemented in this repository uses the QuickHull algorithm. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Find the leftmost and rightmost points in the set to define the line segment that forms the base of the convex hull.
2. Divide the points into two subsets, one lying above the line segment and the other lying below it.
3. For each subset, find the point farthest from the line segment. These two points become the endpoints of the convex hull.
4. Repeat the process recursively for the two subsets of points lying outside the triangle formed by the base line segment and the two endpoints.
5. Continue dividing and recursing until no points remain outside the current triangle.
6. The recursion terminates, and the algorithm returns the set of points forming the convex hull.

## Performance Optimization

This implementation incorporates several performance optimizations to improve the efficiency of the Convex Hull algorithm. These optimizations include:

1. QuickHull: The QuickHull algorithm is known for its superior performance compared to other convex hull algorithms, especially for large point sets.
2. Convex Hull Preprocessing: The implementation preprocesses the input points to remove duplicates and collinear points, reducing the number of points to be processed and improving performance.
3. Geometry Computations: The implementation utilizes efficient geometric computations, such as cross products and distance calculations, to minimize computational overhead.

## Example

Here's an example demonstrating the usage of the Advanced Convex Hull implementation:

```cpp
#include "ConvexHull.h"
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Create a vector of 2D points
    std::vector<std::pair<double, double>> points = {
        {0.0, 0.0},
        {1.0, 1.0},
        {2.0, 2.0},
        {3.0, 1.0},
        {2.0, 0.0},
        {1.0, 2.0}
    };

    // Create ConvexHull instance
    ConvexHull convexHull;

    // Compute the convex hull
    std::vector<std::pair<double, double>> hull = convexHull.computeConvexHull(points);

    // Print the convex hull vertices
    for (const auto& vertex : hull) {
        std::cout << "(" << vertex.first << ", " << vertex.second << ")" << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Make sure to fill in the appropriate values for the `points` vector based on your specific application.
