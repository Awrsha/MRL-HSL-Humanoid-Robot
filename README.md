## Description

The MRL project was started in 2003 in the Mechatronics Research Laboratory in Islamic Azad University, Qazvin branch looking onward to enhance the knowledge of robotics and the MRL humanoid soccer league is aimed to develop a humanoid platform for research and education. MRL has had a successful history in RoboCup for many years.

* About the Humanoid League :

> In the Humanoid League, autonomous robots with a human-like body plan and human-like senses play soccer against each other. Unlike humanoid robots outside the Humanoid League the task of perception and world modeling is not simplified by using non-human like range sensors. In addition to soccer competitions technical challenges take place. Dynamic walking, running, and kicking the ball while maintaining balance, visual perception of the ball, other players, and the field, self-localization, and team play are among the many research issues investigated in the Humanoid League. Several of the best autonomous humanoid robots in the world compete in the RoboCup Humanoid League.

* About Mechatronic Research Laboratory (MRL) :

> The Mecatronic research center of the Islamic Azad University of Qazvin began its activity in 2003 with a laboratory. There are currently 11 laboratories in the center. Due to the wide scope of the laboratories, the number of researchers, the presence of professors, the value of advanced laboratory equipment, the quality and quantity of laboratory space and the numerous honors gained in domestic and international international competitions, this series has been selected as the country‚Äôs scientific research pole.
